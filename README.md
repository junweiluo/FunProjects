# RotateMatrix

Input a degree (90X) and the matrix will rotate accordingly. 

This is an exercise on "Automate the Boring Stuff Wotj Python".  The instruction is to use raw python and build nested loop.  However, I found using numpy to be much more succint.

I believe using pandas is even better, saving another loop.  The idea, at end of day, is to vectorize data as matrix for easier transformation.
